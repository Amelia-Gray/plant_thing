# plant_thing

MY GOALS:
- make an easily navigable website (i might have made navigable up i cant remember)
- incorporate an easy-to-understand database of plant and gardening knowledge
- create an individualizable calendar for growing food that takes into account
  - hardiness zone
  - daylight
  - temperature
  - rainfall
  - companion plants?

I spent most of my time troubleshooting and researching, so i have not gotten the site to a state i can be proud of (aka I hate it)

I started by creating my own gackgrounds and icons, but none of them would work, no matter what I tried. I moved on to making a modified version of my last project as a base, but I kept encountering issues i didnt know how to solve, in CSS, HTML, AND JavaScript. I then tried to work on the list function, but got sidetracked with debugging. I decided to move on to a different aspect, a log in and account system, and get back to the other things later. I decided to follow a tutorial about making a log in pop-up since I didnt know where to start, but despite following the tutorial EXACTLY, many aspects of it didn't work. I then tried to figure out how i wanted to go about making the calendar, and spent a LOT of time researching, but I couldnt find anything similar to what I was trying to accomplish. I was running out of time at that point, so i went back to trying to solve issues, and made very little progress.

Long story short, I didn't accomplish any of my goals for the project.
